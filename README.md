# TermTalk

> Chat like a hacker. Terminal-style group messaging for developers.

## 🧠 Why?

Me and my friends wanted a way to talk during university lectures that made it look like we were doing work—introduce TermTalk!

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Join a session via a code (or create an existing one)
- Copy a `curl` command in your terminal
- Send messages in real-time via WebSocket

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
